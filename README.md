# DataVisualizer
This application will be able to display rather large datasets in a convenient graphical approach,combinded with some statistical analysis.

It is designed to make it easy to analyse large continual datasets from a range of sensor inputs, where the value is a function of time. Furthermore, it will make it easy to compare different days, weeks, months or any arbitrary time intervals.

The application is written purely in JavaFX 8, and is deeply developed upon a principle of multitasking with background threads managed through a FixedThreadPoolExecutor singleton.
