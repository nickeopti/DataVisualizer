# DataVisualizer
This application will be able to display rather large datasets in a convenient graphical approach, combined with some statistical analysis.

It is designed to make it easy to analyse large continual datasets from a range of sensor inputs, where the value is a function of time. Furthermore, it will make it easy to compare different days, weeks, months or any arbitrary time intervals.

The application is written entirely in JavaFX 8, and is from the very beginning developed upon a principle of multitasking, where background threads are managed through a FixedThreadPoolExecutor singleton.

Do however note, that this is an application in development - and it is yet in its *very* early stage, where the different components are being developed and tested, but is *not* combined into anything really useful; just yet...
